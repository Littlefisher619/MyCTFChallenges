# My Switch Game

## Description

Have fun in my interesting snake game :)

Relay bt traffic and capture by https://github.com/mart1nro/joycontrol

## Hint

1. To solve it, a switch or a switch pro controller is not necessary. Even you have one, that may hardly helpful

2. flag's format is RCTF{xxx} and length of "RCTF{xxx}" is 32.

3. Plz check out https://github.com/mart1nro/joycontrol/blob/master/scripts/

   Relay script and data-parse script are in it.

4. Flag is stored in a array. It's dynamically-generated and affect by the snake's status.

5. Source code is based on https://github.com/CompSciOrBust/Cpp-Snake-NX/
